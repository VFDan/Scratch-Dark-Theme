# Scratch-Dark-Theme

Scratch Dark Theme gives the Scratch 3.0 user interface a refresh with a dark theme and new modern look.

This is automatically turned off on private pages such as the account creation page and the account management page for added peace of mind. This also applies the new 3.0 style to the navigation bar on all pages.

Check out the [Compatibility List](https://github.com/VFDan/Scratch-Dark-Theme/blob/master/compat.wiki) to see what this extension currently supports.


## How to use:

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension (this also works with Greasemonkey, but support is not guaranteed).
2. Go to https://github.com/VFDan/Scratch-Dark-Theme/raw/master/Scratch%20Dark%20Mode.user.js.
3. Click Install.
4. Use Scratch in Dark Mode!
