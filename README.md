# Scratch-Dark-Theme

Scratch Dark Theme gives the Scratch 3.0 user interface a refresh with a dark theme and new modern look.

This is automatically turned off on private pages such as the account creation page and the account management page to protect your 

privacy. This also applies the new 3.0 style to the navigation bar on all pages.

## Credits:

Thanks to Scratch user **44D3A7HQ** for the `addGlobalStyle` function and inspiration for the color scheme. They are not a member of the official development team but their work is greatly appreciated.
